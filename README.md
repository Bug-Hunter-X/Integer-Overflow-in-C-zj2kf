This repository contains a simple C program demonstrating an integer overflow bug and its solution. The bug.c file shows the problematic code where an integer variable may exceed its maximum representable value. The bugSolution.c file provides a corrected version that uses appropriate data types and checks to prevent overflows.  Understanding integer overflow is crucial for writing robust and reliable C code.
